      <img src="Chelsea.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Chelsea McGovern">

      <p> Chelsea McGovern is a rare original Austin Unicorn. Though she was born in the southern city of the weird, she has the heart of a wanderer. After she escaped the infamous prison known as "highschool," she put on her snow shoes and traveled Northbound. After searching long and far, she found a settlement in New York where she went to SUNY Binghamton. 
      <p> There she earned two libral arts degrees of English Rhetoric and Behavioral Psychology and with some personal ingenuity, blood, sweat, and tears she became a professional Social Media Ninja, Blog afficionato, and CMS tamer. </p>

      <p> When shes not up to her elbows in code or running around local events, she can be found in a cafe reading about strange medical oddities and collecting hedgehog gifs on her Pinterest. </p>
      <p> If you come across a Chelsea roaming in the wild, try to tame it with Sushi, Thai Food and musical comedy. Yet beware you just might end up in her novel. </p>
